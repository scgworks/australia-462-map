# 🇦🇺 Australia 462 Visa Work Eligibility Map

### 🗺️ Helping Working Holiday Visa (Subclass 462) holders find eligible work areas in Australia

This project was created to make it easier for **Working Holiday Visa (subclass 462)** holders to understand which regions and postcodes in Australia are **eligible for specified work**.

The official government resources can be difficult to visualize — so this map shows all **eligible areas and industries** directly on an interactive map.

## 💡 Why I Made This

Hi! I’m **Steven (scgworks)** 👋  

I started learning programming recently, and this is one of my first big personal projects.  
When preparing for my Working Holiday Visa, I noticed how confusing it was to check if certain jobs or postcodes were eligible for 462 visa extensions.  

So, I built this map to:
- Help 462 visa holders quickly see eligible regions  
- Learn web development and data visualization along the way  
- Share something useful with the community 🌏  

This project is **non-commercial** — it’s made for learning and for helping others.
