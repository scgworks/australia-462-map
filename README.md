# 🇦🇺 Australia Specified Work for 462 Visa Map

### 🗺️ Helping Subclass 462 Working Holiday Visa Holders Find Eligible Work Areas in Australia

This project, **Australia Specified Work for 462 Visa Map**, is designed to help **Working Holiday Visa (Subclass 462)** holders easily identify which **regions and postcodes** in Australia qualify for **specified work** to complete their 88 and 176 days for 2nd and 3rd visa extensions.

The goal is simple — to make official government information more accessible, visual, and practical for travelers and workers.

## 💡 Why This Project Exists

Hi! I’m **Steven (scgworks)** 👋  

When preparing for my own Working Holiday Visa, I realized how complicated it was to figure out which jobs and postcodes counted toward visa extensions. The government’s information is scattered, often text-only, and hard to visualize.  

So, I built this project to:
- 🗺️ Show all eligible regions and postcodes on one interactive map
- 🧭 Make it easier to plan specified work for 462 visa holders
- 💻 Learn web development and data visualization by doing something helpful
- ❤️ Share it freely with others in the same situation

This project is **non-commercial** and made out of a desire to help, learn, and contribute to the 462 community.
